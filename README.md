### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node and NPM installed.

- Node `v12.10.0` (_You can quickly switch to the correct version with `nvm use` if you have it installed._)
- NPM `>6.10.3`

### Development

Out-of-the-box, things are pretty simple:

1. üì¶ **Install dependencies.** I use `ci` instead of `i`/`install` to avoid versioning discrepancies but live your life.

   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

2. üèó **Build project.** This will just do all the bundling without starting a dev server.

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. üõ† **Build and run development server.** This command will start a development server which watches for changes and auto-reloads at `localhost:9000`.

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
